# Project mu-siq
 
Project mu-siq, known as 'μ-sic', stands for 'Monophonic Self-playing Instrument for Capstone'. This project is a prototype built by Team RAMMD, part of the Capstone Course for the Mechanical Engineering Department at USF, Fall 2019.

The project was designed with the intention of creating an instrument capable of processing and parsing an image of a music sheet to read and reproduce the notes on a membranophone. A membranophone was chosen to remove note duration from the variables that needed to be controlled, simplifying the programming and actuation. μ-SIC would serve as a substitute for a live performer when in need of musical accompaniment or affordable, at-home live music. It can also aid in understanding sheet music, which can be a difficult part of the learning process for aspiring musicians.
